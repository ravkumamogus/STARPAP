          <p>Japan's Edo period was very politically interesting. It was ruled by the Tokugawa Shogunate, a military dictatorship founded by Tokugawa Ieyasu. Although Ieyasu was a great warrior, the Edo period was known for being peaceful. Throughout the Edo period, The political rule of the Tokugawa Shogunate improved Japan in many ways.

          <p>As Edo was a Military Dictatorship, the large warrior class dictated a unique Edo economy. As the population of warriors was so dense, it required a tremendous quantity of consumer goods. This called for more people needed in Edo such as merchants and artisans. People came from all over Japan to fill these roles, and thus Edo became a Consumer capital. As there were so many merchants and artisans, they became the lowest classes in society. The hierarchy of the main classes followed the order Warriors, Farmers, Artisans, Merchants.

          <p>Tokugawa Ieyasu created a very feudal society. There was a strict discrimination among the four classes of society. Each trade had its guild and no one was allowed to become a member unless he had first become an apprentice and after a certain period been allowed to become a full-fledged master artisan and to engage in his particular trade. Japan followed the “Master vs Servant” approach to society, not only with these classes, but also with employers/employees and teachers/students.

            During the Edo Period, Europe was a threat to Japan's political stability, through the form of invasion spearheaded by Christianity. Persecuting Christians, and restricting foreign access to the country by closing Japanese ports to all but Dutch and Chinese ships, were the defensive measures taken by the Tokugawa. Their success demonstrated that the threat could be contained.

            These are methods Ieyasu used to improve and save Japan for all his citizens, from jobs and a more active economy to eliminating threats of invasion. They show that even though Ieyasu was a brutal dictator, he could still do helpful things for Japan and help take it to where it is today.
