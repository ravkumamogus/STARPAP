          <p>In 13th Century Edo Japan, many religious beliefs are made visible: The first is how the government brought Chinese beliefs to Japan, The second is how they used forms of Confucianism, Buddhism and Shinto, and the third is how the government used religion to control people.

          <p>One way a belief in religion was strongly shown is how they combined religions from many places. For example, the upper class citizens such as samurai mainly followed Neo-Confucianist beliefs. This was a form of Confucianism described as the Chu Hsi system after one of its most celebrated exponents in China. It was developed during the Sung dynasty (1130-1201), and it was well known and discussed in Japan in the fourteenth century for we learn of arguments by the young noblemen at Go-Daigo's court soon after 1333, arguments for and against the adoption of Chu Hsi teaching as a basis for the policy of the new government. Upper class citizens supported it because the leader and military dictator of Edo, Tokugawa Ieyasu heavily followed it. As stated by David Magarey in his 1964 book Emperor and Nation in Japan: Political Thinkers of the Tokugawa Period, “Once Confucianism had been favoured with the patronage of the tokugawa family, it was not long before the han governments adopted a similar policy. education according to the curriculum of Shushigaku thus became the norm for upper-class samurai throughout the country. By the end of the Tokugawa Period, Chu Hsi's principles were the universal possession of the samurai class, and even the wealthy townspeople were developing a taste for Confucianism.” This shows a focus on religion as Tokugawa Ieyasu, the ruler of Edo Japan brought Confucianism to Japan, which at the time was mainly from China.</p>

          <p>Another way a belief in religion was exemplified is how people in Edo period Japan used a combination of Confucianism, Buddhism, and Shintoism. Magarey also claims “This peculiarly Japanese way of thinking, which viewed the emperor as a sacrosanct or inviolable personage under all conditions, was based on Shinto teachings as they had been refined and interpreted down through centuries. Shinto, the ancient "Way of the Gods" of Japan, was undeniably a religion, but the borderlines between religion and philosophy, like those between general ethics and political thought, were not clearly drawn. Certain elements in Shinto belief took on the nature of political principles; and, particularly in the Tokugawa period, many scholars specialised in finding analogies between Shinto and confucianism.”</p>

          <p>One more way the Tokugawa Shogunate used religion was to control people. As Robert Bellah states, “An example of the tendency to value religion for its results in action rather than for its own sake would be the attachment of the warrior class to Zen Buddhism in certain periods. It was seen almost as a system of training which aided in the self abnegating performance of actions expressing loyalty to one's lord.” This demonstrates how the government used religion to encourage loyalty, and is a way the Shogunate used religious beliefs to their advantage. Also stated by George Sansom in 1954, "Ieyasu's 1614 proclamation against Christianity, drafted by the monk Suden, states that Japan is the Land of the Gods. It goes on to identify those gods, the national deities of the Shinto creed, with the Buddhas, and by ingenious argument contrives to introduce into the principles of government which it is announcing a strong flavour of Confucian thought. This proclamation of 1614 seems confused, but in fact its meaning is clear. Its purpose was to secure the acceptance of an ethical code consistent with the aims of the Bakufu, namely absolute rule over a disciplined society." This is a great example of how the used different parts of several religions to gain power in Edo Japan.</p>

          <p>This is how the Tokugawa Shogunate used religion in their society, and how they use several religious beliefs from many religions to gain absolute power over their citizens and how they bring many religions together to create one to be the best fit for their government.</p>
