          <p>In Japan's Edo period, the dictator, Tokugawa Ieyasu, chose to use Neo-Confucianist philosophies from China to aid his rule. Neo-Confucianism, or Shushi-Gaku in Japanese, was based around obedience, loyalty, and respect. This helped a lot to get his citizens to follow him as he had just taken over Japan.

          <p>Neo-Confucianism was developed by Chinese philosopher Chu Hsi during China's Sung Dynasty. It was based around the world being rational and explainable, rather than the mysticism of Japanese Buddhism. At first glance, the decision to follow Neo-Confucianism goes against the beliefs of Japan, especially when used in tandem with Buddhism, but Ieyasu mainly used it to gain loyalty and power.

          <p>Ieyasu brought Neo-Confucianist beliefs from China as they were beneficial to the society he was trying to make. As stated by George Sansom in his book A history of Japan: 1615-1867, Page 71, “Ieyasu felt that he needed a philosophical principle to explain and buttress the authoritarian system of government which he intended to impose on the country. What could be better than that which Chu Hsi described when he stated that the fixed principle of the universe was the law of obedience by the son to the father, the subject to the matter.”

            By getting his citizens to follow Neo-confucianism, Ieyasu could keep his followers loyal and support the feudal society he was trying to build.
